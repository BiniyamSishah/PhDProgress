It seems I am lost with my tasks as a PhD student. I have lost control of my shedule and research drive. I am constantly thinking or become engaged in things that do not add a significant value to the PhD or my life. 

I need to plan.
a) My courses
Finished credits:  26.6
Finished course but didn't finsh the exams: 21 credits.. in consideration IOF (4) AOF (4) and T&CFD (6), last course is not verified
Total : 47.6 credits/ minimum is 42 credits before September....

questions:

1) Check how many credits IOF & AOF are and correct your course folder?
2) Start working on the exams of the finished courses?
3) write your PhD or paper.
4) Slowlly start working on the collabrative researches. 
5) Help Professor write the " espression of interests with "Amazon web services". 
6) End your relationship with Kidist. 
7) time your work
8) Continue excersising, eating and sleeping healthy, meeting friends and using your time effciently.
